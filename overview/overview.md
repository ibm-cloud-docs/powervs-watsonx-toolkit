# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx integration
{: #getting-started}

## Why {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
{: #why-powervs}

[{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power](https://www.ibm.com/power) is a family of high-performance servers that are based on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power processors. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power is designed to support high-performance computing, large-scale data processing, and essential applications like ERP, CRM, and database systems. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power is known for its Reliability, Availability, and Scalability (RAS), performance and sustainability.

[{{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} (PowerVS)](https://www.ibm.com/products/power-virtual-server) is an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Power server Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} resources reside in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} data centers with separate networks and direct-attached storage. The internal networks are fenced but offer connectivity options to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure or private cloud environments. This infrastructure design enables {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} to maintain key enterprise software certification and support as the {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} architecture is identical to certified private cloud infrastructure.
