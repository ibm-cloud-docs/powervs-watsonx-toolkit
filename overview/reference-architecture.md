This document provides reference architectures and design decisions for applications and services hosted on IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} to integrate with IBM managed watsonx SaaS services or client managed watsonx software in IBM Cloud.


## Overview
{: #overview}

Even though IBM Power is designed for AI and has built-in features to accelerate AI, as discussed in the [Getting Started page](/docs/powervs-watsonx-toolkit?topic=powervs-watsonx-toolkit-getting-started), and one can certainly train AI models anywhere and deploy them on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, this article is not focused on running AI models on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. Rather, this article discusses how to integrate {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx, and take advantages from both of them.

The diagram below highlights the high-level communication between {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx services:
1. To extend the mission critical workloads with watsonx, the applications hosted on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} can invoke inference APIs on watsonx service endpoint;
2. To allow cloud native AI applications or watsonx services to make use of the data or applications hosted on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, watsonx needs to access the private services hosted on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. The watsonx.governance service can also use similar path to monitor AI models hosted on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} if needed.

## Architecture diagram
{: #architecture-diagram}

For watsonx, client could choose to use the SaaS offering and create instances of the services they are interested in. In this case, IBM managed the watsonx stack and client consumes the corresponding cloud services.

There are also cases that clients would like to train or fine tune the AI models, and host the models themselves. In this case, client needs to set up their own stack and manage watsonx themselves.

We will discuss the reference architectures for both watsonx as SaaS and watsonx as software.

### IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS integration
{: #architecture-diagram-saas}

First, let's discuss {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS integration. Let's take a look at two flavors of the reference architecture.

In this case, client has some workloads on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}, which could be databases, applications, or even AI models hosted on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}. If the client also has other cloud workloads in VPC, we would recommend multiple VPCs for separation of concerns between edge networking controls, provider management, and consumer workloads. Refer to [VPC reference architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about) in IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services for recommended architecture and best practices.

![{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS integration (with workloads in VPC and on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}})](../images/powervs-ai-SaaS.svg "{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS integration (with workloads in VPC and on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}})"){: caption="{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS integration (with workloads in VPC and on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}})" caption-side="bottom"}

IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS connectivity:

* Applications and services on IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}s may need to use watsonx SaaS, for example, application running on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} needs to invoke LLM hosted in watsonx.ai
  - 1.1 Direct Connectivity (NAT): {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} provides a built-in NAT service for direct connectivity to IBM Cloud Services. This option offers a maximum speed of 10Gbps.
  - 1.2 Virtual Private Endpoint (VPE): For IBM Cloud Services that has VPE enabled (eg. COS), you can create a VPE pointing directly to the Cloud Service. This method typically provides the highest throuput.
* IBM Cloud Services (eg. watsonx.data) needs to connect to databases or services (eg. DB2 or Oracle) hosted on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
  - 2.1 Satellite Connector enables private connectivity to {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} workloads. Satellite Connector and agent need to be configured and deployed.
  - 2.2 IBM Cloud Services connect to target services on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} via secure private channel.

This architecture includes {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} Workspace and three VPCs, which provide segmentation for edge traffic control, management functionality, and consumer workloads.

If the client only has workloads on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and no other workloads in VPC, we would recommend to set up edge VPC to control traffic flows and do not expose {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} directly. The diagram below is a simplied version of the reference architecture, where network flow and bastion host can be set up in the edge VPC.

![{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS integration (with workloads on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}})](../images/powervs-ai-SaaS-edge.svg "{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS integration (with workloads on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}})"){: caption="{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx SaaS integration (with workloads on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}})" caption-side="bottom"}

IBM provides different flavors of deployable architectures to automatically provision {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environment. Refer to [Power Systems Virtual Server with VPC landing zone](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/{{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}-vpc?topic={{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}-vpc-automation-solution-overview) for details.

You can also refer to [Gen AI pattern for watsonx on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/pattern-genai-rag?topic=pattern-genai-rag-genai-pattern), which discusses Gen AI patterns without {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}.


### IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx software integration
{: #architecture-diagram-software}

If client chooses to deploy their own stack and have a single tenant watsonx to train, tune, or host their own models, they can deploy watsonx on OpenShift cluster at location of their choice. The reference architecture below shows the watsonx stack deployed in workload VPC in IBM Cloud.

IBM {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} and watsonx software connectivity:
* Client deploys watsonx software in client owned VPC
* Power Workspace and VPC are connected via Transit Gateway
